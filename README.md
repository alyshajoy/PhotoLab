Photolabs is a dynamic web application designed for photo enthusiasts and photographers alike. It offers a platform to explore a wide array of photographs, with features that allow users to like their favorite photos, discover photos through various topics, and view similar photos to those they show interest in. Our goal is to provide an engaging and intuitive user experience for discovering and appreciating photography.

## Features

- **Explore Photos**: Users can browse through a collection of photos curated from diverse photographers.
- **Like Photos**: Found something you love? Users can like photos to show appreciation for the work.
- **Sort by Topics**: Whether you're interested in nature, urban landscapes, or portraits, photos can be sorted by topics to tailor the browsing experience to your interests.
- **Discover Similar Photos**: When viewing a photo, users can also explore similar photos to dive deeper into styles or themes they like.
